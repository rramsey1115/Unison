UNISON
================
UNISON empowers musicians to optimize practice sessions with features like session repetition, goal-setting, and personalized timelines. Unison also includes robust tools for teachers, streamlining student management, assignment creation, and progress tracking. The collaborative platform fosters communication between musicians and teachers, creating a supportive community within music education.

This full-stack application was built as my Full-Stack Capstone project for Nashville Software School's Web Development Program.

Built with React on the front-end, .NET framework on the back-end, and PostgreSQL for data management, UNISON represents a comprehensive project where I planned and implemented every aspect. This includes the wireframe, Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), Project Board, User Stories, and GitHub branch management for each feature.

I successfully achieved my Minimally Viable Product (MVP) by the end of week 1, providing ample time to surpass minimal requirements. Key accomplishments include implementing CRUD functionality in three different areas of the application and creating a "heatmap" to visualize users' practice frequency.

This was a great learning experience for me, and represents how much I was able to learn in 6 quick months. When I started this course, I was a beginner who had never written a line of code. I have just scratched the surface, and can't wait to build better and more powerful applications in the future.
